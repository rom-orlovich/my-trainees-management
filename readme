## **Some comments**:

I made a basic app design.
There are a lot improvments and features that I will add soon .
After all, it's a long run final-project.

I'm using React-Redux TLK and React-Redux-TLK-query for state and fetching management.

Also, I'm using React-Hook-Form for forms state management and
validate the form with yup schemas.

If something is not clear about these techs , you are more than welcome to ask.
