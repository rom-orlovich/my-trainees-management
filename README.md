# **About my project:**

My Trainees app management is a web app application that assists
personal trainers in managing their business’s system.
\
The app helps the trainer manage his trainees training and nutrition programs, his leads and his business’s financials.

# **About me:**

My name is Rom Orlovich, I'm a highly motivated Full Stack Developer who has experience with cutting-edge technologies like React ,TypeScript , Node, Express, MongoDB, Sql, ect.
\
As a self employed personal trainer, I wanted to combine my passion for programming with the world of personal training.

# **Why I chose this project:**
As a personal trainer, I have experienced difficulties with managing my business due to not having a single app that comprises all of the tools I needed.
/
Therefore, I've decided to create one myself - An app that creates an overview of my trainees and their progesses.
