## About my project:

My Trainees app management is a web app application that assists
personal trainers in managing their business’s system.
\
The app helps the trainer manage his trainees training and nutrition programs, his leads and his business’s financials.

## Why I chose this project:
As a self employed personal trainer, I wanted to combine my passion for programming with the world of personal training.
\
During my work I have experienced difficulties with managing my business due to not having a single app that comprises all of the tools I needed.
\
Therefore, I've decided to create one myself - An app that creates an overview of my trainees and their progesses.
